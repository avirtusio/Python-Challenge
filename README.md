Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

The homework is completed.

The text files are located in the Analysis folders, but the CSV files were not uploaded into GitHub since the files were to large. Also members from the Slack channel stated that only the analysis and python files need to be pushed into our GitHub respository. 

Let me know if you have any questions! 

Thank you :)
